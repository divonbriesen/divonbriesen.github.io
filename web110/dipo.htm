<li>
	<b>Personal background:</b> Troop 118 Eagle Scout, Gamer, and professional slim jim
</li>

<b>Professional/Academic</b> background: Myer Park High School Graduate, Held a job associated with the IRS.

<b>Information/Technology background:</b> Limited knowledge of C ++ and HTM

<b>Background in subjects of this course:</b> I took some code academy lessons, back when it was free, and got introduced to web design through that.

<b>Primary computer platform:</b> My primary computer that I use now is a Dell 15 inspiration series with an i3 7th gen Intel graphics card. Itâ€™s not too strong, but it will get me through till i can get the funds to build a computer of my own, I got it for Christmas

<b>Reason for taking each course:</b> My for this semester are ENG 111, SGD 111, and of course WEB 110

I'm taking Web design in hopes of getting a good job, where they won't judge me for my physical disability, and to build my own website when I finally get my business up and running so I wonâ€™t have to rely on sites like Squarespace. I don't think itâ€™s a good idea for me to allow another business to manage a part of my business like that.

I'm taking SGD because it what I want to do for a personal business, itâ€™s also something I've been dreaming about for a long time. I have already attempted to start it once, had a team and everything save money, but things happened and it fell apart. My art guy got married, the twins went to college, my sound guy fell out of touch, and my co-founder fell in the classic " Teenage Puberty Drama " It was a hard blow for me because I invested so much into it already, mentally and physically, but it thought me that I couldn't just assemble some half-baked team and expect a well-oiled machine. I had to work for it.
Finally, I'm in ENG 111 because I have to, though I do enjoy writing
<b>Funny story or interesting item to remember me by:</b> You want a story? Alright.

I remember when I was still going on camping trips with my troop, I had already gotten my eagle and had a lot of free time so I would attended as many as I could, There was this one canoing trip that I still laugh at till today.

It was the trip where I could have drowned.

When my scout master, Mr. Pace, was assigning pairs for canoes he wanted the older scouts with the younger less experienced scouts. Nothing wrong or upsetting about that, I thought it was good idea. I was paired with a little boy named Morgan, who was said to be highly annoying, to whom I had little face to face interactions with. After a speech about safety and precautions we were set out into the river and got on our way. Now this wasn't any lazy, slow river. It was a sneak up and take you to church type of river. The boy was a stick in the mud about rowing, I was in the back and was charge of power, while Morgan had steering. He would easily get tired and stop, placing the paddle flat on his lap I picked up his slack, I don't think I minded then, not until we reached quicker waters.

We were gaining speeds and heading straight for a large and slightly intimidating rock. Morgan was giving little effort, I told him to "PADDLE!"

He gave a little more effort, then he stopped, and placed his paddle on his lap.

We get closer and closer, I was paddling like I was digging for gold. â€œPADDLE MORGAN, WE'RE GONNA CRASH!" He responded with something " I think it was " I don't want to " or " Itâ€™s too late " I paddled harder, he sat there slouched over " I don't know how he was heading face first into mother nature's elbow ", I managed to turn us sideways, then we crashed, the boat flipped over and dumped us into the river like dirty laundry. I was under water for about a minute or so as the water pulled me along for a ride. I was a poor swimmer so I was especially scared, I finally popped up to see Morgan alive and not drowned, which was good â€œI wasn't that mad " , and the overturned canoe next to him. Being the oldest one around at the time I to the canoe and set it right.

He apologized to me and I respond with "GET THE FUCK INTO THE CANOE MORGAN!" He quickly scrambled in and I stayed in the water to act as an anchor till an adult arrived.

Itâ€™s fair to say that I didn't let him live that down for a while after.
